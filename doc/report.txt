Used express auto generated node.js server. Root request returns employees page. 
Const data stored in the file data/employees.csv - I think in read program in must be in dqatabase.
CSV - JSON conversion used by 'csvtojson' library (installed by npm). 
After JSON array sorted by self maden bubble sort procedure. Need to remember what all data from CSV will be a string as need to use +empl.salary not empl.salary.
Presentetion used technology JADE with using JAvaScript. 
For my opinon for solution of this problem better to use react.js with node.js (express Ok) technology. React is better for presentation layer and node.js is 
good to use for data (JSON) supplying.
